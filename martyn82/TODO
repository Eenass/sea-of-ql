TODO
----
- Environment
    - Add column and linenumber to TypeErrors.
- Store type in question

operator instanceof is only valid in some cases when the RHS is a type/interface, not a class.

- The type checker needs an environment with an Identity:Type map
- The evaluator needs an environment with an Identity:Value map
- Use interface types as typehint for arguments and return types.
- .class and getClass must be removed!
- assert assumptions
- make codelocation class to bundle column and linenumber QLLexer

- review typechecker
- review renderer (mixed responsibilities)

- better place for either ui package or evaluator.value package, ui uses value
