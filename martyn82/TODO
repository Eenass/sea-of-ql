TODO
----
- Environment
    - Add column and linenumber to TypeErrors.
- Store type in question

operator instanceof is only valid in some cases when the RHS is a type/interface, not a class.

- The type checker needs an environment with an Identity:Type map
- The evaluator needs an environment with an Identity:Value map
- Use interface types as typehint for arguments and return types.
- assert assumptions
- make codelocation class to bundle column and linenumber QLLexer

- review typecheckerhelper
- review renderer (mixed responsibilities)
- review environment

- better place for either ui package or evaluator.value package, ui uses value

- test for typeresolver
- test for typeinitializer
- test for controls
