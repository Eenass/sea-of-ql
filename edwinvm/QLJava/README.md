QLJava Jan-Feb 2013
========================
QLJava project at the University of Amsterdam, for the course Software Construction.

USAGE INFORMATION
======================
 - Use QLJava to generate questionnaires from a QL DSL.
 - You can find an example of this DSL in this location: QLJava/resources/Questionnaire.ql
 - This DSL will be parsed to a AST, which is used to render a GUI.
 - Please see the unit tests to get a thorough idea of how the parser and the QL AST work.
 
INSTALLATION
======================
 - You need Eclipse IDE and the ANTLR plugin or JAR installed to run QLJava (the JAR is included in the project lib directory).
 - More info on ANTLR at http://www.antlr.org/
 - For the Java SWING LayoutManager handling, a third party component has been used. It's included in the lib directory (MigLayout JAR).
